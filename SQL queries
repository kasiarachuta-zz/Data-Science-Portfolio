Below are the sample queries I have run at YN:<br>
The table names have been changed for confidentiality purposes<br>
<br>
<b>QUERY 1:</b>
The aim of this query is to find judges in YN network that have judged the highest number of startup competitions.
I now want to find judges from our startp competitions. I have to look in three tables: our judge table (where
each judge has an id but doesn't actually have a name), people table (where there are names of people from our
database) and finally, the table with e-mail addresses.
I also want to sort this list by people who have judged most startup competitions. I want to only look at the entries 
that have actually been judged.
