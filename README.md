# Data-Science-Portfolio
This is my awesome data science portfolio. It includes: <br>
a) SQL Queries - SQL queries that I have run in my internship at YN (some of the names of the tables have been changed for confidentiality purposes) <br>
b) Travel exercises - where I analyse the data on flights from Boston to Cancun and answer the questions of how much a consumer should expect to pay for a return trip. The aim of this exercise is to produce a consumer-oriented article. I mainly use mean, median (and other quartiles) as these are easily understandable to the consumer; I also used multivariate and polynomial regression. <br>
c) Women and YN1K - a study I did on the demography on females and top startups in the YouNoodle network. Methods used: ANOVA, chi-square. <br><br>
