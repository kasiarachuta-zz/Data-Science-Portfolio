# Data-Science-Portfolio
This is my awesome data science before. It includes:
a) SQL Queries - SQL queries that I have run in my internship (some of the names of the tables have been changed for confidentiality purposes)
b) Travel exercises - where I analyse the data on flights from Boston to Cancun and answer the questions of how much a consumer should expect to pay for a return trip.
c) Women and YN1K - a study I did on the demography on females and top startups in the YouNoodle network
